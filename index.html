        <h2>What does chadev mean?</h2>
        <p>Chadev is short for Chattanooga developer.</p>
        <h2>What's our purpose?</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to create a central location for Chattanooga developers, programmers, and hackers to ask questions, show off projects, share links, post events, etc.</p>
        <h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
        <p>We are still working out the details. For now, we have created a <a href="http://chadev.reddit.com">subreddit</a> that will work as the hub. We will let you know along the way what other shapes this project might&nbsp;take. <br />Keep it classy, Gig City!</p>
