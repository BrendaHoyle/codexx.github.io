<h1>CodeXX is an organization where women learn and code together.</h1>

<p>We work in any framework, and come from all professional backgrounds and experience
  levels. We believe that by building a supportive community of female coders,
  we can create a brave, new class of Chattanooga women working in technology. </p>
